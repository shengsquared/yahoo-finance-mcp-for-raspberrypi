## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Dependencies as listed in `pyproject.toml`, including:
  - mcp
  - yfinance
  - pandas
  - pydantic
  - and other packages for data processing

## Setup

### Recommended: run with `uvx`

Run the server directly from the repository without creating a local virtual environment:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/Alex2Yang97/yahoo-finance-mcp yahoo-finance-mcp
```

### Local development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Alex2Yang97/yahoo-finance-mcp.git
   cd yahoo-finance-mcp
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run the packaged entrypoint with:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/Alex2Yang97/yahoo-finance-mcp yahoo-finance-mcp
```

For local changes in this checkout, use:

```bash
uvx --from . yahoo-finance-mcp
```

### Development Mode

If you are working inside a local clone and want to run the source tree directly:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

### Running as a network service

By default the server talks MCP over stdio, which means the client launches it. To keep it
running on one machine and connect to it from another, serve it over HTTP instead:

```bash
yahoo-finance-mcp --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The endpoint is then `http://<host>:8000/mcp`. Each flag has an environment variable
equivalent — `YFINANCE_MCP_TRANSPORT`, `YFINANCE_MCP_HOST`, `YFINANCE_MCP_PORT`,
`YFINANCE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`, `YFINANCE_CACHE_DIR` — and `--transport sse` is available for
clients that still use the older SSE transport. By default there is no authentication; add
`--client-id`/`--client-secret` (or `YFINANCE_MCP_CLIENT_ID`/`YFINANCE_MCP_CLIENT_SECRET`)
to require them as HTTP Basic Auth credentials on every request. Do not put an
unauthenticated server on an untrusted network.

### Raspberry Pi

The server runs well on a 64-bit Raspberry Pi (Pi 3 or newer, including the Zero 2 W). To
install it as a systemd service that starts on boot:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shengsquared/yahoo-finance-mcp-for-raspberrypi.git
cd yahoo-finance-mcp-for-raspberrypi
sudo bash scripts/install-pi.sh
```

A Docker Compose setup is included too (`docker compose up -d --build`). See
[docs/raspberry-pi.md](docs/raspberry-pi.md) for OS and Python requirements, why 64-bit
matters, how to connect Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or a claude.ai custom connector from
another machine, resource and security notes, and troubleshooting.

### Integration with Claude for Desktop

To integrate this server with Claude for Desktop:

1. Install Claude for Desktop to your local machine.
2. Install VS Code to your local machine. Then run the following command to open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
   - MacOS: `code ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `code $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Edit the Claude for Desktop config file, located at:
   - macOS: 
     ```json
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "yfinance": {
           "command": "uvx",
           "args": [
             "--from",
             "git+https://github.com/Alex2Yang97/yahoo-finance-mcp",
             "yahoo-finance-mcp"
           ]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
   - Windows:
     ```json
     {
       "mcpServers": {
         "yfinance": {
           "command": "uvx",
           "args": [
             "--from",
             "git+https://github.com/Alex2Yang97/yahoo-finance-mcp",
             "yahoo-finance-mcp"
           ]
         }
       }
     }
     ```

   - **Note**: You may need to put the full path to the uv executable in the command field. You can get this by running `which uv` on MacOS/Linux or `where uv` on Windows.

4. Restart Claude for Desktop
